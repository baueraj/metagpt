## Logic Analysis

- ['dom_parser.py', 'DOMParser class should be implemented first as it is a prerequisite for Main and SentimentAnalyzer']
- ['sentiment_analyzer.py', 'SentimentAnalyzer class depends on the output of DOMParser']
- ['main.py', 'Main class integrates DOMParser and SentimentAnalyzer and should be implemented last']

## Task list

- dom_parser.py
- sentiment_analyzer.py
- main.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'dom_parser.py' contains the 'DOMParser' class which is responsible for parsing HTML and extracting headlines.
        'sentiment_analyzer.py' contains the 'SentimentAnalyzer' class which is responsible for performing sentiment analysis on the extracted headlines.
        'main.py' contains the 'Main' class which integrates 'DOMParser' and 'SentimentAnalyzer' and provides the main entry point for the application.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

We need more clarity on the threshold value for hiding a headline. It is also unclear how the existing DOM parsing code works and how it can be integrated with the sentiment analysis code. We need access to the existing code or detailed documentation.
