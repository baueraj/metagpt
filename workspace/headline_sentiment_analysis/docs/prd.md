## Original Requirements

Generate code to modify the display of headlines on a webpage based on their sentiment, hiding negative headlines. Generate and use Python code to perform the sentiment analysis on a given text using nltk.sentiment.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer or a similarly fast package. Assume that I already have Python code to parse the DOM of a news website landing page and extract headlines.

## Product Goals

- Create a Python code to analyze sentiment of headlines
- Hide negative headlines from the webpage
- Ensure the sentiment analysis is efficient and fast

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see only positive news on the webpage
- As a user, I want the webpage to load quickly without any delay
- As a developer, I want to easily integrate the sentiment analysis code with the existing DOM parsing code

## Competitive Analysis

- Product A: Provides sentiment analysis but does not hide negative headlines
- Product B: Hides negative headlines but does not provide sentiment analysis
- Product C: Provides sentiment analysis and hides negative headlines but is slow
- Product D: Provides fast sentiment analysis but does not hide negative headlines
- Product E: Hides negative headlines and provides fast sentiment analysis but is difficult to integrate

## Requirement Analysis

The product requires Python code to perform sentiment analysis on headlines and hide the negative ones. The code should be efficient and fast to ensure a smooth user experience. It should also be easy to integrate with the existing DOM parsing code.

## Requirement Pool

- ['Create Python code to perform sentiment analysis on headlines', 'P0']
- ['Hide negative headlines from the webpage', 'P0']
- ['Ensure the sentiment analysis is efficient and fast', 'P1']
- ['Make the code easy to integrate with the existing DOM parsing code', 'P1']

## UI Design draft

The UI will remain largely unchanged as the changes are mostly backend. However, users should notice a lack of negative headlines. The design should remain clean and uncluttered, with headlines clearly visible and easy to read.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear what is considered a 'negative' headline and how strong the sentiment has to be for a headline to be hidden. It is also unclear how the existing DOM parsing code works and how it can be integrated with the sentiment analysis code.
