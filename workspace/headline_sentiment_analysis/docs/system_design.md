## Implementation approach

We will use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for sentiment analysis. NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources. We will use the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class from nltk.sentiment.vader module which is specifically built for sentiment analysis. We will also use BeautifulSoup, an open-source Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that are helpful to extract the data easily. We will integrate the sentiment analysis code with the existing DOM parsing code using a modular approach for easy integration and testing.

        }

            +SentimentAnalyzer sentiment_analyzer

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant DP as DOMParser
        participant SA as SentimentAnalyzer
        M->>DP: extract_headlines()
        DP-->>M: return headlines
        loop for each headline
            M->>SA: analyze_sentiment()
            SA-->>M: return sentiment_scores
            Note over M: Check if sentiment is negative
            alt if sentiment is negative
                M->>M: hide headline
            end
        end
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear how strong the sentiment has to be for a headline to be hidden. We need more clarity on the threshold value for hiding a headline. It is also unclear how the existing DOM parsing code works and how it can be integrated with the sentiment analysis code. We need access to the existing code or detailed documentation.
