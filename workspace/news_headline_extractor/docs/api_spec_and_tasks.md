## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', "Main entry of the application, responsible for instantiating the correct class based on user's input and calling the extract_headlines() method."]
- ['news_domains.py', 'Contains the classes for each news domain. Each class should implement the extract_headlines() method.']
- ['headline_extractor.py', 'Contains the base class for all news domains. This class should provide common functionality such as sending HTTP requests and parsing the DOM.']

## Task list

- headline_extractor.py
- news_domains.py
- main.py

## Shared Knowledge

The 'headline_extractor.py' contains the base class for all news domains. This class provides common functionality such as sending HTTP requests and parsing the DOM. The 'news_domains.py' file contains the classes for each news domain. Each class should implement the extract_headlines() method. The 'main.py' file is the main entry of the application, responsible for instantiating the correct class based on user's input and calling the extract_headlines() method.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific tags and patterns for each news domain are not specified. We will need to analyze each domain to determine the best way to extract headlines. Additionally, the performance requirements are not specified. We will need to test the system under different loads to ensure it meets the users' needs.
